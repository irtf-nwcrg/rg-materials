### 00- Welcome, administrative and general matters    
(Chairs) (5')

This last meeting is the right time to highlight what happened in our RG since its creation, a bit more than 8 years ago.

### 01- NWCRG, status after 8 1/2 years (2013 - 2021)
(Chairs, all)

NB: verbatim of the [slides presented during IETF111](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/111/materials/slides-111-nwcrg-01-nwcrg-status-01)

- 2021-07: last meeting during IETF 111
- 2021-09: "BATS" to be sent to IRSG "tentative)

#### Three additional RFCs 

2020-01: publication of three RFC, all of them managed by the IETF TSV WG but initiated within NWCRG:

- RFC 8680: "FECFRAME extension for sliding window codes
- RFC 8681: "sliding window RLC codes"
- RFC 8682: "TinyMT32 PRNG 

#### But also controversy

- After 8 years of silent participation to NWCRG/TSVWG (no IPR disclosure), on March 2020 CodeOn disclosed a patent against RFC 8681 "Sliding window RLC FEC schemes for FECFRAME", soon after the RFC being published:    
[https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/4069/]

- Pretty uncomfortable situation as MJM is listed as co-inventor but convinced this IP does not apply to RFC 8681:    
[https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/nwcrg/n4DeGM_4xRzQChPX7NQ9CUmThvo/]

- Full support of IRSG chair and several NWCRG participants towards MJM:    
[https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/nwcrg/vk_7y3JyPSWJdXNkCcs3EdOegaY/]

#### And a few regrets

- no "Random Linear Network Coding" with in-network recoding RFC (!): two I-D initiated by CodeOn, but never finalized.
BTW CodeOn explained (June 2018) they had no reason disclosure any IPR for this doc:    
[https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/nwcrg/1hMBDR4XLE0cXbj4BOGhW5doYU0/]

- no Tetrys RFC: an I-D initiated but never finalized

- no "FEC for QUIC" nor "RLC for QUIC" RFC: 
QUIC v1 RFC publication took too long, and lack of resources within the team:    
[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-swett-nwcrg-coding-for-quic/]    
[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-roca-nwcrg-rlc-fec-scheme-for-quic/]

- SWIF (sliding window FEC codec) hackathon project:
almost done, but not finalized because of lack of resources and difficulties with remote hackathon:     
[https://github.com/irtf-nwcrg/swif-codec]

#### What’s next?

- IRSG processing of:    
[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-nwcrg-nwc-ccn-reqs/]
[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-nwcrg-coding-and-congestion/]
 
- BATS codes:    
RG LC remains to be done but I-D has already been carefully reviewed (soon to start)
then IRSG processing (September?)


**We’re almost done, this is our last meeting, thank you all, it was a pleasure!**
