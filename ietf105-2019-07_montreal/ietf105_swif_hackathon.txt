### SWIF Codec, encoder:

-   T1.01: - DONE - glue between the generic API and RLC codec
-   T1.02: - DONE - work on GF(2\^8) math library: reuse gardinet lib,
    understand how to use it, see if something is missing.

-   T1.04: (OA) work on encoder\_release()

-   T1.06: work on swif\_encoder\_set/get\_parameters()
-   T1.07: - DONE - work on swif\_build\_repair\_symbol(): requires to
    generate the coding coefficients (see RLC I-D) and to computate of
    the linear combination.
-   T1.08: work on encoder\_reset\_coding\_window()
-   T1.09: - DONE - work on
    encoder\_add\_source\_symbol\_to\_coding\_window()
-   T1.10: work on
    encoder\_remove\_source\_symbol\_from\_coding\_window()

-   T1.12: work on encoder\_set\_coding\_coefs\_tab()
-   T1.13: work on swif\_encoder\_generate\_coding\_coefs()
-   T1.14: work on encoder\_get\_coding\_coefs\_tab()

### SWIF Codec, decoder:

-   T2.01: work on new source or repair symbol reception
-   T2.02: linear system decoding using the GF(2\^8) math library:
    includes linear system representation (C structure), progressive
    decoding upon receiving repair symbols involving erased source
    symbol(s)
-   T2.03: work on decoder\_create()
-   T2.04: work on decoder\_release()
-   T2.05: work on set\_callback\_functions()
-   T2.06: work on decoder\_set/get\_parameters
-   T2.07: work on decoder\_decode\_with\_new\_source\_symbol(): relies
    on work done on task "linear system decoding"
-   T2.08: work on decoder\_decode\_with\_new\_repair\_symbol(): relies
    on work done on task "linear system decoding"
-   T2.09: work on decoder\_reset\_coding\_window()
-   T2.10: work on decoder\_add\_source\_symbol\_to\_coding\_window()
-   T2.11: work on
    decoder\_remove\_source\_symbol\_from\_coding\_window()
-   T2.12: work on decoder\_set\_coding\_coefs\_tab()
-   T2.13: work on decoder\_generate\_coding\_coefs()

### SWIF Codec unitary test:

-   T3.1: - DONE - find a way to add unitary tests.
-   T3.2: - ON PROGRESS - add as many unitary tests as possible for the
    encoder.
-   T3.3: add as many unitary tests as possible for the decoder.
-   T3.4: add as many unitary tests as possible for the server/client
    transmission.

### C-language server/client application:

-   T4.1 - DONE - work on server (i.e., the encoding/sending side):
    requires to design a trivial packet format (transmission of the FEC
    OTI can be static on the opposite), set up the UDP connection,
    design a simple rate control scheme (to avoid saturating the
    receiver), and use the generic API to create repair symbols. This
    work should enable to provide feedback on the Generic API I-D.
-   T4.2: (VR) work on client (i.e., the decoding/receiving side): set
    up the UDP connection, use the generic API to manage source/repair
    symbols, to recover from erased source symbols. Test the whole
    transmission/reception chain. This work should enable to provide
    feedback on the Generic API I-D.

### Python wrapper:

-   T5.X: - ON PROGRESS - (MJM, CA)

### Python test and simulation applications:

-   T6.X: (MJM, CA)

### I-D/API fixes done:

None yet.

### Active I-D/API fixes that remain to be done:

-   TODO: the esi\_t is probably inappropriate. In certain situations,
    it may be a 64-bit long identifer, in other situations it may be an
    offet (e.g., see RLC for QUIC).
-   TODO: do we really need the encoder\_reset\_coding\_window()? This
    is clearly useful at the decoder (specify a brand new coding
    window), but we expect most encoders to manage their encoding window
    continuously, without needing to reset it altogether. A decision
    needs to be taken: keep it or remove it.
-   TODO: build\_repair() cannot be used when the buffer is allocated
    locally. Error in the API.
-   TODO: during the end of session, at an encoder, should we call the
    callback each time we free a symbol or not? We need to clarify this.
-   Added INVALID\_ESI to the API. Needed during session startup (first
    symbol submission). Use another approach to avoid reserving an ESI
    value to the INVALID state?
-   TODO: swif\_encoder\_get\_coding\_window\_information() is not
    appropriate when there's non contiguous symbols (e.g., with
    re-coding use-cases). We need to decide what to do.

Decisions taken, API and I-D fixes @ IETF104 hackathon
------------------------------------------------------

### Decisions

### Licencing considerations:

-   decision to use a BSD licence. Yes
-   authors of existing code reused by the SWIF codec
    (Cedric/Vincent/...) agreed to switch to a BSD licence
-   TODO

### SWIF Codec project targets:

-   Focus on an RLC codec first (as per [RLC
    I-D](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tsvwg-rlc-fec-scheme/)),
    the RLNC codec will be addressed as a second step (it will share a
    lot of code anyway).
-   Design the SWIF Codec + tiny C language server (encoding
    side)/client (decoding side) application.
-   Add a Python wrapper to the SWIF Codec, then Python test and
    simulation applications.

### Strategy

-   Work on encoder first, with an operational SWIF encoder + server
    application. Add unitary tests for the encoder.
-   Then work on decoder and test the whole chain: server - client. Add
    unitary tests for the decoder and the whole chain.
-   In parallel, work on Python wrapper and python applications.

### I-D/API fixes done:

-   clarify that this SWIF-codec is not meant to be thread-safe.
-   clarification for buffer init/free in function
    swif\_build\_repair\_symbol().
-   clarification (added examples) for the definition of codepoints
-   typo (encoder instead of decoder) in
    swif\_decoder\_reset\_coding\_window (ptr to swif\_decoder\_t rather
    than swif\_decoder);
-   update to the generic control block structure (addition of pointers
    to the codec specific versions of the API functions).
